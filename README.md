# Stock-Returns-Prediction
Stock market is viewed as tumultuous, mind boggling, unstable and dynamic. Without a doubt, its prediction is one of the most herculean task in time series prediction. Long short term memory (LSTM) networks are a best in class method for time series and sequence learning. Normally they are not applied to financial sequences, yet they are quite appropriate for this project. We used LSTM networks for forecasting the future stock prices from the historical prices, predict the stock returns and finally use binary classification to predict the direction of stocks.
